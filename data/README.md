# Data

This folder is reserved for dataset documentation and data curation artifacts for **TruPharma**.

TruPharma will use a curated pipeline of pharmaceutical safety data to support:
- retrieval and grounding (RAG),
- entity normalization (drug/symptom mapping),
- and benchmarking/evaluation.

## Planned sources (links and access notes will be added)
- OpenFDA (FAERS adverse events + labeling)
- RxNorm (drug normalization / entity linking)
- DrugBank (interactions and clinical context; license-dependent)
- BLUE Benchmark (optional evaluation support)

## What will go here
- dataset links + access instructions
- notes on dataset size/modality/update frequency
- provenance/version logs (when pulled, from where, with what filters)
- known limitations/biases/coverage gaps
